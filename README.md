# Instructions
Run the terminal command "node app.js" to run the program.


# Notes
When adding an employee it loops through the entire process, otherwise things would get messy fast.

# Images
The images in the images folder show some of the functions (gifs were not legible)


# Additions to make:
The delete function still needs a SQL update to work properly
